Generic binary classifier with functions to read in data, train an XGBoost classifier, predict using trained model, and assess the model. Crab species datasets (from Crab Datasets below) are used as an example.

## Binary_Classifier_GaussianNB.py
Naive-Bayes version of Binary_Classifier.py with same functionality and examples used.

## Crab Datasets
ðŸ¦€ Species datasets: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mattop/snowcrab) (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mattop/southern-tanner-crab-geospatial-data-19752018).
